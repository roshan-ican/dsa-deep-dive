# Trapping Rain Water
# Hard
# Topics
# Company Tags
# Hints
# You are given an array of non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value height[i] 
# represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.
# Return the total amount of water that can be trapped between the bars.
# Example 1:
# Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

# Output: 9
# Constraints:

# 1 <= height.length <= 20,000
# 0 <= height[i] <= 100,000
